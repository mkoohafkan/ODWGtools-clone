# ODWGtools

An R package for common tasks associated with the
Outlier Detection working Group, including outlier detection,
unit conversion and time series smoothing.

This is a clone of a package I developed while working for the
California Department of Water Resources. I have kept this
snapshot of my work as a learning tool/reference/example.
The original package is now maintained by others and
is available to the public: https://github.com/ODWG/ODWGtools.
